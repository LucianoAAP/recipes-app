# The project

This is a slightly modified version of a front-end group project I had to develop during my studies at the "Trybe" web development course. The application was made using React.js and was designed for devices with a screen resolution of 360 x 640. It is an app for finding various meals and drinks recipes and it uses two APIs whose documentation can be found in:

- https://www.themealdb.com/api.php
- https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php

It also has unit tests currently covering about 60% of the lines of the files in the "src" folder.
